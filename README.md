# theOdinProject-Etch-a-Sketch

the goal of this project is to exerce my skills in javascript, DOM manipualtion and flexbox/ 
the instruction come from the foundations course of webdev from the odin project 
they are : 
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try to create them by hand by copying and pasting them in your HTML file!
It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.
Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). 

The refined instructions are : 
1) create the repo and the boilerplate html (open the cheatsheet html flexbox) 
2) create a loop that create 16 divisions in a container div. 
3)use flexbox to create a grid of squares 
4)hovering effect that changes the color of the square

observations : idea 1 : create N elements and put them in the container 
with flex, flexdirection column, make them evenly space rows
create N elements, put them in each row
with flex, make them even size well repartition
3-1) create N rows 
3-2) create a loop which creates N column in each row
4) container : display flex it and evenly distribute  the space between the element
5) do the same which each of row which are containers the columns elements
6) add an eventlistener for everydiv which changes background color when mouse enters
7) add a button 
8) add an eventlistener to make pop up show to the user prompt the number of square he wants 
9) delete the grid and create a new one with the number of the prompt 
10) add a random nackground color to the div when mouseenters
